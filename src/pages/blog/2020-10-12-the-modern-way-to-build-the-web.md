# Create a **complete website** in the time it usually takes to build a prototype

Build sites with the services you want, like Shopify, Stripe, and WordPress, quickly and easily with Gatsby’s 2000+ plugins. Integrate data from anywhere: APIs, databases, CMSs, static files — or multiple sources at once.

Gatsby loads only **critical**1 parts of the page, so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby **prefetches**2 resources for other pages so that clicking on the site feels incredibly fast. Gatsby lets teams focus on creating content-driven websites instead of worrying about performance.

## Gatsby sites build fast**no matter where they’re deployed.**



Gatsby ships with a sophisticated caching and dependency tracking system we’ve spent years perfecting. Gatsby intelligently avoids re-executing redundant parts of the build so that sites build and deploy, on average, **2.5x faster than other static frameworks.**

For even faster builds and deploys, we built Gatsby Cloud, custom-built cloud infrastructure for taking your Gatsby site to its fullest potential.
